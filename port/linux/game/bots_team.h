/* bots_team.h: what a team of bots of either kind agrees on (port/linux/game/bots_team.c)

Both kinds of bots (bots_common.h) play capture the flag's carrier by one
set of rules, kept here once a tick for each team:

- the team's carrier of the other team's flag: the player holding it, or,
  the flag lying away from its stand, the one who let it go to fight (still
  the carrier while alive and near it), or the bot of the team nearest it
  (the carrier killed, or the flag dropped by a player gone);
- where the carrier goes: home to score, or, the gametype's captures needing
  the team's own flag at home and it away, to a hiding place near home (not
  the stand, which the enemy watches) until the flag is back; back to the
  flag when it let it go;
- whether it lets the flag go to fight: hiding, an enemy in sight and near
  (a flag holder cannot fire; a flag lying 17 s untouched goes home:
  bots_team_ctf_regrab_now says when to go back for it);
- the team's other bots leave the other team's flag to the carrier when it
  lies dropped, and one bot (the nearest) guards the hiding carrier.

And a vehicle's crew (bots_team_crew_*): a driver in a Warthog, bot or
person, calls for the free bots of its team nearest it, one or two, the
gunner's seat first, who drop what they were doing and board it; a bot
driver waits for them a few seconds. */
