/*
HALO_ONSCREEN_KEYBOARD.H

The on-screen keyboard (port/linux/game/onscreen_keyboard.c), OpenCE's
text chat's, in the menus' look: a QWERTY page and a symbols page of ten
columns, and a last row of wide keys (capitals, the page, space, delete,
and done). A controller moves through its keys and presses the one
picked, a tap presses the one under it. Its callers type with it: the
text chat in a game (network_chat.c) and the menus' text fields
(virtual_keyboard.c's free text, menu_functions.c's text fields); each
draws it where it goes, and keeps its own text.
