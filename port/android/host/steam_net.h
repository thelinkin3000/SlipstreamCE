/*
STEAM_NET.H

What the Steam client sends and reads, below its messages: an HTTPS GET
(the host's host_https_get), plain TCP and HTTP over the host's
posix_socket calls, and protocol buffers, written and read field by field
(steam_cm.c's messages are Steam's, as SteamKit and DepotDownloader document
them). The client is the host's, on every build (Android, Switch, PS5): the
guest only shows what steam_downloads.c lets it have, and never holds a
Steam token.
