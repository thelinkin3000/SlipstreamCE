/*
STEAM_DOWNLOADS.C

steam_downloads.h's model, in the host (from Halo Content Evolved's
port/linux/src/steam_downloads.c, which ran in the guest). Three threads of
its own do the work: the session's (signing in and out, the Workshop's
pages, asking Steam about the installed packages), the files' (downloads one
at a time, from a queue the screen adds to, removals, and reading what
mcc_maps holds) and the previews'. The connection server is taken in turn
(session_lock).

The screen's calls (the guest's, each frame, through host_steam_*: the end
of this file) read only what those threads left under state_lock: no file
or network is touched there, and the lock is held only to copy.

The session's file (steam_seal.h: the app's private storage on Android, the
data root's steam folder on the consoles): "account=", "seed=" (32 hex
digits: this install's identity, from which the logon's machine id is
made) and "sealed=" (the refresh token a sign-in gave, sealed with a key of
the device's: steam_seal.c), or "token=" where the device has no such key.
The token never leaves the host: the guest is shown the account's name.
Logging out revokes it with Steam as well as forgetting it here. What was
downloaded is in steam/downloads.txt of the data root: "shared <manifest>"
and "<item id> <manifest>" lines, so an item updated since shows UPDATE.

/* ---------- a joiner's fetch of an MCC package's resource maps

A player joining a game on an MCC map it lacks downloads the package from the
host (port/linux/game/mcc_share_session.c), and the package's own bitmaps.map
and sounds.map, most of its size, from the Workshop at once when the package
is a Workshop item and this install has a Steam sign-in: the guest names the
item and the resource files the host's list gives (name, size, SHA-256); this
thread finds them in the item's manifest by name and size, downloads them to
mcc_staging/steam_fetch, and checks each against the host's SHA-256. The
guest then copies a ready file into its staged download (checking it again)
and tells the host it has it (MCC_SHARE_OP_HAVE), which every host takes:
nothing new goes between the machines. A file the host reaches first, or the
item lacks, is the host's (host_steam_fetch_skip). */
