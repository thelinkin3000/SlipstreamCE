# stb_truetype

A TrueType font rasterizer in one C header, by Sean Barrett (RAD Game
Tools), public domain or MIT licensed, as the user chooses (see
`LICENSE`).

Upstream: https://github.com/nothings/stb, commit
2c980bb59875b0d32144a71867fbdebb2f77cd20 (`stb_truetype.h` v1.26), copied
unchanged.

The game's text is drawn with fonts from `port/assets/fonts`, rasterized
with it at the display's resolution (`port/linux/src/text_hires.c`); it
builds into the Linux, Windows and Android platform layers.

# stb_image

`stb_image.h` v2.31, the same author and licence, from the same repository's
master: the Steam Workshop screen decodes items' preview pictures (JPEG,
PNG) with it (port/android/host/steam_downloads.c, in the hosts), built there with only those
two formats.
