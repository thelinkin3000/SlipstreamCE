/* pgbots_rules.h: the Proving Grounds bots' rules (port/linux/game/pgbots_rules.c)

The second kind of bot (bots.kind "provinggrounds", next to Birchwood's
bots.c) decides with these: plain numbers in, plain numbers out, no call into
the engine, so that the harness runs them as they are
(tools/harness/tests/test_pgbots_rules.py). pgbots*.c read the game and ask
them.

Clean room: the design is research_notes/ppg-bot-personalities.md, written in
our own words after Project Proving Grounds' bots (PolyForm Noncommercial:
none of its code is here, nor may be).

Units: distances in world units, angles in radians, times in seconds unless
a name says ticks (30 a second). A `random` argument is a number from 0 to 1
(the bot's own random numbers: pgbots_rules_random01). Skill levels are
bots_combat.h's (recruit to legendary). */
