/* bots_common.h: what the two kinds of bots share (port/linux/game/bots.c)

The bots come in two kinds (bots.kind): Birchwood's (bots.c and its helpers,
halo-ce-vita's bots with this port's rules) and Proving Grounds' (pgbots*.c,
a clean-room brain after research_notes/ppg-bot-personalities.md). Both are
players of machines of their own (bots.h), and both take from bots.c the
plumbing that makes a bot a player and reads the world: the settings, the
lines of sight and the ground, the vehicles' and weapons' tag facts, the
powerups and turrets found once a second, the path searches (three slots for
every bot of either kind, in the tick or on the helper thread), and the
action written as a player's (one-tick presses).

These are bots.c's own functions, unchanged, behind names of their own: a
Birchwood bot does what it always did. Each bot records its kind when it
joins (bots_network_player), so one game may hold both. */
